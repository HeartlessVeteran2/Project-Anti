## 1. Core Concepts

### ADB Functionality
-   **What it is**: Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device. The Project-Anti app provides a user-friendly interface to many ADB commands.
-   **Benefits**:
    -   Execute commands without a computer connection
    -   Perform device management tasks directly on the device
    -   Access system information easily

### Shizuku Integration
-   **What it is**: Shizuku provides a way to access system APIs that normally require special permissions.
-   **Requirements**:
    -   The Shizuku app must be installed on your device (available on Google Play or GitHub).
    -   Shizuku must be activated (either via ADB or root method).

### Accessibility Service
-   **What it does**: The accessibility service provides additional functionality for navigating and interacting with the system UI.
-   **How to use**:
    -   Navigate to Android Settings > Accessibility.
    -   Find "Project-Anti" in the list of services and enable it.
    -   Return to the app to use enhanced features.
