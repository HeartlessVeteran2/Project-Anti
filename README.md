   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Project-Anti.git
   ```
2. **Open in Android Studio**:
   - Launch Android Studio and select "Open an existing project."
   - Navigate to the cloned repository and open it.
3. **Build the Project**:
   - Allow Android Studio to sync and build the project.
4. **Run on a Rooted Device**:
   - Connect your rooted Android device to your development machine.
   - Run the app from Android Studio.
5. **Grant Permissions**:
   - The app will request root access and accessibility service permissions. Grant these to enable all features.

5. **Open a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

To achieve **maximum administrative control**, the app uses **root access** via `su` commands to:
- **Access System Files**: Read/write to `/system` or `/data/data` for private app data (e.g., `FileManager`, `MalwareManager`).
- **Modify System Settings**: Alter secure settings like screen brightness (e.g., `DeviceManager.modifySystemSettings`).
This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.
For **educational purposes only**. Use only on devices and apps you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical. Always use cleanup functions post-testing to remove malicious artifacts. Rooting poses security risks; use trusted sources (e.g., Magisk).

### 9. Testing and Debugging Your Apps

- **Test Environment**:
  - Use a rooted Android device or emulator (AVD Manager > Create Virtual Device > Select root-enabled image).
  - Install your test apps (e.g., `com.example.test`) on the device.
  - Enable Accessibility Service: Settings > Accessibility > Root ADB Controller > Enable.
  - Grant `su` access via Magisk or SuperSU.
- **Testing Scenarios**:
  - **Input Simulation**: Test UI vulnerabilities by simulating taps/keys (e.g., bypassing login screens).
  - **Keylogging**: Log text inputs to check for sensitive data exposure.
  - **Data Exfiltration**: Send app data to a test server to test leakage protections.
  - **Persistence**: Install a test script to verify detection of unauthorized startups.
  - **Code Injection**: Inject code into app data to test integrity checks.
  - **Network Monitoring**: Capture traffic to test network security (requires `tcpdump`).
  - **Private Logs/Files**: Access app logs/files to test sandboxing.
  - **Silent Install**: Install a test APK to check unauthorized install detection.
  - **Admin Control**:
    - Grant `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` to test privilege escalation.
    - Kill app processes to test crash recovery.
    - Modify system settings (e.g., brightness) to test system-level impacts.
  - **Cleanup**: After each test, use cleanup functions to remove:
    - Malware (`com.example.test` and its data).
    - Keylogs (`/sdcard/keylog.txt`).
    - Persistence scripts (`/system/etc/init.d/test_script`).
    - Injected code (e.g., `/data/data/com.example.test/shared_prefs/test.xml`).
    - Network captures (`/sdcard/network.pcap`).
- **Debugging**:
  - View outputs in `tvOutput` (TextView).
  - Use Android Studio’s **Logcat** (View > Tool Windows > Logcat).
  - Debug errors (e.g., “Permission denied”) by ensuring root access and Accessibility Service.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Update placeholder paths (e.g., `/sdcard/test.apk`, `/sdcard/test_script.sh`) with actual paths.
  - Set up a test server for data exfiltration (e.g., use `ngrok` for `http://your-test-server.com`).
  - Install `tcpdump` for network monitoring (place binary in `/system/bin`).

### 10. Building Exclusively in Android Studio

Android Studio handles all development tasks:
- **Coding**: Write Java classes in the code editor (e.g., `MainActivity.java`).
- **UI Design**: Use the **Layout Editor** (Design tab) for `activity_main.xml`.
- **Building**: Compile with **Build > Make Project** or **Run > Run ‘app’**.
- **Debugging**: Use **Logcat**, **Debugger**, and **Profiler** (View > Tool Windows).
- **Testing**: Run on a device/emulator via **Run > Run ‘app’**. Configure emulators in **AVD Manager**.
- **Version Control**: Manage GitHub via **VCS > Git** (commit, push).
- **Dependencies**: Handle libraries in `build.gradle`.
- **APK Signing**: Sign APKs in **Build > Generate Signed Bundle/APK**.

### 11. Limitations

- **Root Dependency**: Most features require root access, limiting non-rooted devices.
- **Accessibility Service**: Input simulation/keylogging depends on user-enabled Accessibility Service.
- **Network Dependency**: Data exfiltration needs a test server; network monitoring requires `tcpdump`.
- **Security Risks**: Rooted devices are vulnerable. Use cleanup functions and unroot post-testing.
- **Path Hardcoding**: Update placeholders (e.g., `/sdcard/test.apk`, `com.example.test`) for your apps.

### 12. Conclusion

This guide enables you to build an Android app **exclusively in Android Studio** with **maximum administrative control** using **root access**. It includes **ADB-like functionalities**, **advanced hacking techniques** (e.g., keylogging, data exfiltration, code injection), and **cleanup functions** to test your apps’ security and remove malicious artifacts. The app is designed for **ethical testing** on your own apps/devices and hosted on GitHub. If you provide your GitHub username, I can tailor the `git remote` command, or if you need more features (e.g., privilege escalation exploits) or specific test scenarios, let me know!
