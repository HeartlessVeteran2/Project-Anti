# Project-Anti Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the Project-Anti codebase to enhance stability, security, and maintainability.

## Build System Improvements

### Gradle Configuration
- Updated Gradle wrapper from milestone version 9.0-milestone-1 to stable version 8.6
- Fixed future timestamp in gradle-wrapper.properties
- Removed duplicate proguard configuration in app/build.gradle
- Updated JaCoCo version from 0.8.11 to 0.8.10 for better compatibility with Gradle 8.6

## Code Quality Improvements

### Test Configuration
- Updated Robolectric test configuration to use SDK 34 (matching the target SDK) instead of SDK 28
- Fixed test configuration to ensure compatibility with the latest Android SDK

### MainActivity Improvements
- Added missing imports for Compose state management
- Fixed potential memory leak by moving service binding from `onCreate()` to `onStart()` and unbinding in `onStop()`
- Removed redundant `initializeShizuku()` method
- Moved hardcoded string to string resources for better localization support
- Improved PendingIntent flag handling for Android 12+ compatibility

### AntiDetectionUtils Improvements
- Removed Google Play Store from analysis tools list to prevent false positives
- Modified `clearTraces()` method to preserve shared preferences, preventing potential app crashes
- Improved sensor check logic to be more accurate and reduce false positives on lower-end devices
- Refined `isBeingAnalyzed()` method to use a scoring system for more precise detection

### KillSwitchReceiver Improvements
- Added verification to ensure the kill switch is triggered legitimately
- Implemented a safer cleanup method that preserves essential data
- Replaced dangerous self-destruct functionality with a safer alternative
- Added proper error handling and logging

## Security Improvements

### AndroidManifest.xml Improvements
- Added custom permission for KillSwitchReceiver to prevent unauthorized access
- Added intent filter for the custom KILL_SWITCH action
- Updated tools:targetApi to match the targetSdk value (34)
- Improved component security configuration

## Conclusion
These improvements enhance the stability, security, and maintainability of the Project-Anti application. The codebase is now more robust, follows best practices more closely, and is better prepared for future development.
